# Three JS Clocks

I was tasked with creating a simple clock application for a user to tell time. Originally I was going to make a simple clock but I stumbled on three js tutorials for 3d clocks
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `Routing`
For this, I couldn't complete the routing for react-router fully in app so to check out the the different clocks, you have to type localhost:3000/(whateverclockname).
